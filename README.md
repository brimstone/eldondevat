### Hi there!

I'm a seasoned software engineer, and you've found my github profile!

So far I've spent the last 15 years writing software and building infrastructure
for startups. I am a strong believer in the power of effective remote work, and
the creative and technical benefits of having strong human bonds on technical teams,
be they community-driven, open source, or business-based.
