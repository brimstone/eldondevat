\section{Objective}
To contribute to software systems that have a positive impact on the users and the world around them, via
\begin{itemize}
	\item Communicating with internal and external stakeholders to understand requirements and evaluate strategic and tactical approaches toi technological success.
	\item Designing, implementing, and operationalizing software that fulfills a user need safely and reliably.
	\item Applying best practices related to the engineering and security of code, databases, virtual and physical infrastructure, and organizational effectiveness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recent Experience}
Having worked at startups, I have maintained a
career-long passion for shipping functional code early, and developed the experience to
utilize powerful modern tooling to do so safely and effectively. I have
worked with teams to spearheaded such recent projects as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A comprehensive embedded firmware system built with the Yocto toolkit. Builds were done in AWS via custom Github automation, and could be deployed to test devices minutes after the code changes were pushed. The target architecture
	      changed in the middle of the project (aarch64 to armv7l), and we were able to quickly and effectively retarget to the new architecture due to engineering foresite. \textcolor{BlueViolet}{Effective Enginnering}
	\item An IOT agent communicating securely via mTLS with AWS IOT, and integrating with a variety of cloud functionality for video processing, observability, and cloud control. \textcolor{BrickRed}{Security}, \textcolor{BlueViolet}{Effective Enginnering}
	\item A break-glass disaster recovery system and strategy to enable IOT device recovery in the event of upstream provider outages. \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Reliability}
	\item A terraform strategy for building and deploying per-endpoint AWS lambda functions, decreasing the time to deploy new API endpoints to less than a day, including per-endpoint monitoring and Authn/Authz. \textcolor{BrickRed}{Security} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Reliability}
	\item A Kubernetes operator to deploy a distributed database, enabling TLS certificate provisioning to secure communications into and between nodes. \textcolor{BrickRed}{Security}
	\item A bluetooth-enabled Flutter application. Linting, testing, and internal releases were performed continuously for both android and IOS via Github automation. \textcolor{BrickRed}{Security}, \textcolor{BlueViolet}{Effective Enginnering}
\end{itemize}


\section{Technology Focus}
In order to deliver software to users, I typically use technology and tooling such as
\begin{itemize}
\item Github Issues, JIRA, and shortcut to manage requirements and feature developments, which I often model in
\item OpenAPI or GRPC in order to leverage the extensive software ecosystems around each to scaffold software faster, which I usually implement in
\item Golang or flutter to build business logic and implement tests, services, and clients. If better solutions exist in Python, Ruby, or Java, I have extensive experience in those as well, and will use them when they are the right choice or already filling the need.
\item Github Actions, Gitlab Pipelines, or Jenkins usually lint and build the code I write, execute tests, and generate container images, which scan for security posture adherence and then integrate into
\item Kubernetes or Terraform to deploy software to a cloud provider in execution environments such as Lambda, EKS or GKE. I have also worked with operating Kubernetes as a platform on bare metal in production environments.
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Topics and Accomplishments}
Adjacent to my daily work, I improve my craft and contribute back to the community in a variety of ways, including
\begin{itemize}
	\item Presenting at BSides Atlanta 2020 as a remote speaker on \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLCaAaUd1mM}{\color{blue}Cloud Security tooling}
	\item Contributing miscilaneous improvements and fixes to projects such as the AWS terraform provider, wireshark, and qemu.
	\item Obtaining the Certified Kubernetes Administrator recognition from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
  \item Deploying and maintaining the installation of Open Source video conferencing technology enabling remote meetings of the Atlanta Cybersecurity community facilitating presentations by numerous cybersecurity professionals to the public.
\end{itemize}
